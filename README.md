rhcloud experiment--' need a file server program for webpages
I needed a serverside program to interact with webpages.  So, I openned an Open Shift account.  This program is on GitHub.
I need to shift it a little.
Do you know anyway to shift Git Hub repo's to Open Shift without going through your own 'puter?
